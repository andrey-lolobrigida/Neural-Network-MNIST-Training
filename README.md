# Neural Network with MNIST Training
A deep neural network script.

Here, we built a DNN script from scratch, with a customizable layer architecture and learning rate.
Plus, we included a script for training it on the MNIST Dataset, using the Stochastic Gradient Descent
as the learning method.

Made for learning purposes.
